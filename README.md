# quadratic-equation

This is a simple project I wrote to learn basic Clojure syntax.

## Installation

Download from https://github.com/gwyddie/quadratic-equation.clj.git

    $ git clone https://github.com/gwyddie/quadratic-equation.clj.git

## Usage

You can run it with [lein](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen).

    $ lein run

The execution steps are self-explanatory, you'll be asked for the coefficients of the quadratic equation (a, b and c).

### Bugs

No bugs found so far.

And you can run the tests with lein too.

    $ lein test

As I said before, it was a project written to learn about Clojure, therefore suggestions are very welcome.

That's all folks.
